        <p>We recognize that trust is a crucial aspect for organizations, 
          as they face increasing competition for funding, emerging 
          geopolitical threats, a fierce competition for talent, and rising 
          expectations for sustainable impact on all stakeholders. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Many organizations are recognizing the importance of trust in creating value, 
          but they may be at different stages of building it. Some may be trying to understand 
          the concept, while others may struggle with conflicting stakeholder expectations. 
          That's why we're sharing our own plan for building trust, which includes identifying 
          our own weaknesses, building on our strengths, and being transparent about the information 
          that our stakeholders care about most.
